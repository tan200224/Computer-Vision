# Image Alignment

The goal of this assignment is to take the digitized Prokudin-Gorskii glass plate images and, using image processing techniques, automatically produce a color image with as few visual artifacts as possible. In order to do this, you will need to extract the three color channel images, place them on top of each other, and align them so that they form a single RGB color image. We will assume that a simple x,y translation model is sufficient for proper alignment and will ignore other potential changes such as rotation.
